# PYTHON TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

Welcome to the Python Tic-Tac-Toe game! This simple project has been created with the purpose of helping me learn the Python programming language whileby coding a classic game.

## How to Play
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the objective is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. One player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. Players take turns placing their symbols on the 3x3 game board.

Here's how the game works:

1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.
2. Choose if you are playing against another player or against the computer.
3. Players will take turns entering the position where they want to place their symbol.
4. The game will display the updated board after each move.
5. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

## Running the Game
To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

+ Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
+ Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
+ Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
+ Run the following command to start the game:

```
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

+ Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter the position numbers to place your symbol on the board.

## Learning Objectives
This project is a great opportunity to practice and learn various aspects of Python programming, including:

* **Basic Syntax:** Understand the fundamentals of Python syntax, such as variable declarations, conditionals, loops, and functions.
* **Data Structures:** Utilize a dictionary to represent the game board.
* **User Input:** Learn how to capture user input and use it to drive the game's logic.
* **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to deal with invalid inputs gracefully and improve the user experience.
